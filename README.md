```

## Gameplay

MiniSweep is a classic minesweeper game with the added ability to change themes. Here's a quick rundown of the gameplay mechanics:

**Objective**: Reveal all the squares on the grid that do not contain mines.

**Revealing Squares**: Click on a square to reveal it. If it contains a mine, you lose the game.

**Numbers**: Revealed squares show numbers indicating how many mines are adjacent to that square.

**Flagging Mines**: Right-click to flag a square that you believe contains a mine.

**Quick Reveal**: If you click on a revealed square that has a number, and the number of adjacent flagged squares matches that number, all adjacent non-flagged squares will be revealed.

**Theme change**: You can change theme from the main menu, or by pressing F1 while in game.

Enjoy the game!
